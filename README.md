# DaVinci Resolve iMessage Export Notifications

A Lua script for DaVinci Resolve that automatically sends iMessage notifications when your exports complete. Specifically designed for large, multi-hour renders and batch export workflows.

## What it does

- üì± **Sends iMessage notifications** when exports finish (success or failure)
- üéØ **Smart completion detection** - monitors file creation, stability, and queue removal
- üìä **Rich export details** - includes project name, render time, file size, and format
- ‚è∞ **Handles large exports** - designed for multi-hour ProRes renders and batch jobs
- üîÑ **Multiple detection methods** - file monitoring + job queue tracking for reliability
- üé¨ **Batch export support** - monitors multiple simultaneous render jobs

## Key Features

### Intelligent Export Detection
- **File stability monitoring** - ensures exports are truly complete, not just started
- **Job queue tracking** - detects when render jobs are removed (completion signal)
- **Multi-hour support** - configured for 8+ hour monitoring with smart timeouts
- **Large file handling** - proper validation for multi-GB ProRes files
- **"and more" support** - handles jobs that export multiple files

### Rich Notifications
- ‚úÖ **Success**: "Export Complete! üìΩÔ∏è ProjectName üìÅ filename.mov ‚è±Ô∏è 2h 15m üíæ 12.3 GB"
- ‚ùå **Failure**: Clear failure notifications with timeline and format details
- üé¨ **Batch Summary**: "All 5 exports completed! ‚è±Ô∏è Total time: 6h 23m"
- üìà **Progress** (optional): Real-time updates at 25%, 50%, 75% completion

### Production-Ready Features
- **External drive support** - works with network and external storage
- **Timeout protection** - won't run indefinitely (8-hour default)
- **Multiple export formats** - MXF, MOV, ProRes, DNxHD, etc.
- **Timeline-specific exports** - shows which timeline completed

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **macOS** (uses AppleScript for iMessage integration)
- **DaVinci Resolve** with Lua scripting support
- **Messages app** configured with your Apple ID

### Setup
1. **Download the script** (`imessage_notification_script.lua`)

2. **Copy to DaVinci Resolve scripts folder**:
   ```
   ~/Library/Application Support/Blackmagic Design/DaVinci Resolve/Fusion/Scripts/
   ```

3. **Configure your recipient** in the script:
   ```lua
   local CONFIG = {
       iMessageRecipient = "your-email@icloud.com", -- Your iCloud email or phone number
       -- ... other settings
   }
   ```

4. **Restart DaVinci Resolve** (if already running)

## Configuration

Edit the `CONFIG` section at the top of the script:

```lua
local CONFIG = {
    -- REQUIRED: Your iMessage recipient
    iMessageRecipient = "your-email@icloud.com",  -- or "5551234567"
    
    -- Monitoring settings
    checkInterval = 15,                           -- Check every 15 seconds
    maxWaitTime = 28800,                          -- 8 hour timeout for large exports
    
    -- Message content
    includeProjectName = true,                    -- Show project name
    includeRenderTime = true,                     -- Show render duration
    includeFileSize = true,                       -- Show final file size
    sendProgressUpdates = false,                  -- Enable for progress notifications
    
    -- Large file detection (for multi-hour exports)
    fileStabilityWait = 15,                       -- Wait between size checks
    fileStabilityThreshold = 30,                  -- File stable for X seconds
    enableJobRemovalDetection = true,             -- Detect job queue removal
    
    -- Debug mode
    debugMode = true,                             -- Shows detailed console output
}
```

## Usage

### Large Export Workflow
1. **Set up your render queue** with multiple jobs
2. **Start all renders** in DaVinci Resolve's Deliver page  
3. **Run the script** via **Workspace ‚Üí Scripts**
4. **Walk away** - perfect for overnight or weekend renders
5. **Get notified** as each export completes

### Example Multi-Job Workflow
```
1. Add 5 timelines to render queue (ProRes exports)
2. Run: imessage_export_notifications.lua
3. Script detects: "üé¨ Starting 5 exports in DaVinci Resolve"
4. Leave computer running overnight
5. Wake up to notifications:
   - "‚úÖ Export Complete! üìΩÔ∏è DAY01 üìÅ A_0001C001_250624_093430_p1F0F.mov ‚è±Ô∏è 2h 15m üíæ 12.3 GB"
   - "‚úÖ Export Complete! üìΩÔ∏è DAY02 üìÅ A_0002C001_250625_043143_p1F0F.mov ‚è±Ô∏è 3h 22m üíæ 18.7 GB"
   - ... etc for each timeline
   - "üéâ All 5 exports completed! ‚è±Ô∏è Total time: 12h 45m"
```

## How It Works

### Dual Detection Method
1. **File System Monitoring**:
   - Watches output directories for file creation
   - Monitors file size stability (handles large files properly)
   - Validates file modification timestamps
   - Handles "OutputFilename: file.mov and more" scenarios

2. **Render Queue Tracking**:
   - Monitors job status changes in DaVinci Resolve API
   - Detects when jobs are removed from queue (completion signal)
   - Tracks job progress and metadata

### Smart Completion Logic
- ‚úÖ **File exists** in target directory
- ‚úÖ **File size stable** for 15+ seconds (configurable)
- ‚úÖ **File unmodified** for 30+ seconds (configurable)  
- ‚úÖ **File substantial** (>1KB, not just a stub)
- ‚úÖ **Job removed** from render queue
- ‚úÖ Only then sends completion notification

## Sample Notifications

### Large Export Start
> üé¨ Starting 5 exports in DaVinci Resolve

### Individual Completion
> ‚úÖ Export Complete!  
> üìΩÔ∏è DAY03  
> üìÅ A_0003C001_250626_090327_p1F0F.mov  
> ‚è±Ô∏è 4h 22m  
> üíæ 23.1 GB

### Batch Summary
> üéâ All 5 exports completed!  
> ‚è±Ô∏è Total time: 12h 45m

### Progress Update (if enabled)
> üé¨ Rendering: A_0004C001_250627_093722_p1F0F.mov  
> ‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë 75%

### Export Failure
> ‚ùå Export Failed!  
> üìΩÔ∏è DAY05  
> üìÅ A_0005C001_250628_093506_p1F0F.mov  
> ‚è±Ô∏è 45m

## Troubleshooting

### "No render jobs found"
- Ensure jobs are in render queue before running script
- Verify you're on Deliver page with active jobs

### "Export completed but no notification"
For large files:
- Increase `fileStabilityWait` to 30+ seconds
- Increase `fileStabilityThreshold` to 60+ seconds
- Enable `enableJobRemovalDetection = true`

### "False completion notifications"  
- Script detects file creation early
- Increase stability thresholds in CONFIG
- Check that external drives aren't causing file system delays

### "Script times out before completion"
- Increase `maxWaitTime` for very long exports
- Default is 8 hours, increase to 12+ for massive projects

### "Multiple jobs not detected properly"
- Enable debug mode to see job detection details
- Check console output for job IDs and status
- Ensure all jobs show unique `OutputFilename` entries

## Advanced Configuration

### Very Large Projects (8+ hour exports)
```lua
maxWaitTime = 43200,              -- 12 hours
fileStabilityWait = 30,           -- 30 second checks  
fileStabilityThreshold = 120,     -- 2 minute stability
```

### External/Network Storage
```lua
fileStabilityWait = 20,           -- Account for network delays
fileStabilityThreshold = 60,      -- Longer stability for network drives
```

### Multiple Recipients
Modify the `sendiMessage` function to send to multiple contacts:
```lua
local recipients = {"your-email@icloud.com", "5551234567", "colleague@icloud.com"}
```

## System Requirements

- **macOS** 10.14 or later
- **DaVinci Resolve** (any recent version with Lua support)
- **Messages app** with iMessage configured
- **Apple ID** signed in to Messages
- **External storage** (optional) - supports network drives

## Real-World Use Cases

### Documentary Post-Production
- Export 10+ timelines overnight to ProRes 422 LT
- Get notified which ones completed vs. failed
- Perfect for unattended batch processing

### Commercial/Music Video Delivery
- Export multiple format deliverables (ProRes, H.264, etc.)
- Monitor progress during client calls
- Ensure all deliverables complete before deadline

### Color Grading Workflows  
- Export graded timelines to review formats
- Get notifications when ready for client review
- Coordinate with remote teams on completion status

## Performance Notes

- **Minimal system impact** - checks every 15 seconds
- **Network friendly** - works with external/network storage
- **Memory efficient** - designed for long-running monitoring
- **Resolve compatible** - doesn't interfere with other DaVinci operations
